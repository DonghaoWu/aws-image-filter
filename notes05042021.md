6. The .env file is one of the hidden files in which you can store your choice of environment variables. The variables stored in this file are your individual working environment variables. Note that the environment variables that are stored in the .env file override the variables set in the /etc/environment file, that is shared by all users of that computer. You will need to follow the steps below to configure environment variables in a .env file:

    1. Install environment variables package -

    ```bash
    npm install dotenv --save
    ```

    This will allow you to use the environment variables that you'll set in a new file.

    2. Create a new .env file in the root of your project. Fill the .env file with your new variables, and their corresponding values. For example:
    POSTGRES_USERNAME = yourUsername
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD = yourpassword
    AWS_REGION = yourAWSRegion
    AWS_PROFILE=awsProfileName

    3. Require the package in your server - Add the following code on top of the `server.ts` file

    ```js
    require('dotenv').config();
    ```

    4. Use your environment variables - If you want to refer the environment variables that you just saved in the .env file, anywhere in the code, try putting a prefix process.env. in front of the variable name. For example, process.env.POSTGRES_USERNAME will fetch you the value stored in it.

    5. Add .env to your .gitignore - You wouldn't want your .env file to be available publicly in the project Github repository. For this reason, go to the .gitignore file in the project root, and add and entry .env to it. It will make sure that you don't push our environment variables to Github!

7. user => add permissions => attach existing policies | elasticbean stalk(full access) | administer access(remove after deploy) | done

8. Elastic Beanstalk

    - install eb cli

    ```bash
    $ eb init
    $ 14
    $ image-post-dev
    $ Y
    $ Y
